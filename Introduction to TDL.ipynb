Since the maximum rank of the cells in the third network is $3$, the dimension of it is recorded as $3$. Other domains have cells with ranks of $2$ most. Note that the ranks of the orange points(vertices), pink links(edges), blue or purple clusters, and green clusters can be stated as $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$, respectively.

    "A variety of functions, signals, or objects can be defined on topological domains, for instance graphs. These data are called **data supported on topological domain**. Intuitevly, graphs can supported the data on only vertices and edges. However, topological domains having higher-order relations can support data not just on vertices and edges. Higher-order entities can be used for supporting data in these topological domains. For example, vector fields defined on meshes are supported on faces of topological domains such as a cell complex torus.  "

    "Data is processed in graph domain through message-passing algorithm including some concepts like aggregation and updating. Graphs are well-suited for learning and processing data of systems having pairwise interactions. However, these domains may not be successful for modeling complex systems which have higher-order interactions. In such models, the computation of message-passing algorithms may be very costly and we may need higher-order message passing algorithms. For example, although graph neural networks have robust learning models for capturing basic syntax and semantic relations between words, complex expressions such as sarcasm, irony, or negation may not be processed well by mechanisms in traditional GNN. In such learning tasks, we need more complex models processing data supported on domains with higher-order relations. "
