# Introduction-to-Topological-Deep-Learning
This Jupyter Notebook introduces the fundamental concepts of Topological Deep Learning (TDL), which is a novel field combining algebraic topology with deep learning to process complex, non-Euclidean data structures.

## Overview 
Traditional deep learning models such as CNNs and RNNs are effective on structured data like images or sequences but struggle with irregular, high-dimensional data such as graphs, manifolds, meshes, and point clouds. TDL provides tools to incorporate topological structure into neural architectures to better learn from such data.

This notebook covers:

- A gentle introduction to topology and its relevance to machine learning
- Definitions of key topological concepts:
    1. Topological spaces
       a. Manifolds
       b. Graphs
       c. Hypergraphs
    3. Homoemorphisms
    4. Simplicial and cellular complexes
  
- High-level overview of how these structures are integrated with deep learning pipelines

## Prerequisites
To fully benefit from this notebook, you should be comfortable with:

* Basic linear algebra
* Deep learning fundamentals (e.g., layers, training, CNNs)
* Basic understanding of graphs or manifolds (helpful, not required)

## Output and Interpretation
The notebook contains theoretical explanations to demonstrate how topological features can be extracted and fed into deep learning models.
